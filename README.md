SmartAttend
Usage-Based Attendance and Mess Credit System
📌 Project Overview

SmartAttend is a campus-focused system designed to bring fairness, transparency, and efficiency to attendance tracking and mess management in colleges.

In most institutions, students pay a fixed mess fee irrespective of whether they consume all meals. Due to classes, labs, internships, or personal reasons, students often miss meals but still pay the full amount. SmartAttend addresses this gap by introducing a usage-based model where missed meals are compensated using digital attendance coins.

Instead of penalizing students, SmartAttend rewards fairness.

🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional attendance and mess systems suffer from multiple limitations:

Attendance systems operate independently of mess management

Students receive no refund or compensation for missed meals

No transparency in meal consumption data

Fixed “pay regardless of usage” mess fee model

Manual or fragmented attendance tracking

Lack of data to reduce food wastage

As a result, students feel financially burdened, and institutions lack meaningful insights into campus food utilization

💡 Proposed Solution

SmartAttend introduces a single integrated platform that connects:

Attendance tracking

Mess usage monitoring

Digital wallet-based compensation

Core Idea:

If a student skips a meal, its value should not be lost. Instead, it should be converted into reusable digital coins.

These coins can later be used within the campus ecosystem, ensuring fairness while keeping the financial flow internal to the institution.

⚙ How the System Works
1. Attendance Tracking

QR-based attendance system

Supports live camera scanning and image upload

Faculty can also mark attendance manually

Each record stores student ID, date, time, and status

2. Missed Meal Identification

Attendance data is used to infer meal participation

Skipped meals (breakfast / lunch / dinner) are detected

Eligibility for compensation is calculated using predefined rules

3. Digital Coin Compensation

Missed meals generate Attendance Coins

Coins act as refund value (non-cash)

Coins are credited directly to the student’s digital wallet

4. Coin Usage

Coins can be redeemed within campus facilities such as:

Campus canteen

Mess services

Authorized campus stores

This ensures students benefit without money leaving the campus ecosystem
